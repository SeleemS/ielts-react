# ielts-bank.com — Monetization Plan

**Status:** Implemented monetization system — **payments live on Stripe; July 19 production migrations applied and verified**
**Last updated:** 2026-07-19
**Owner:** Founder / eng
**Scope:** How ielts-bank.com goes from free + AdSense to a paid, AI-scoring subscription business without breaking its SEO engine.

> This document is the source of truth for pricing, gating, payments, and rollout. It maps every gate to the **real** Supabase schema already provisioned (`users`, `user_quotas`, `attempts`, `scores`, plus `passages/question_groups/questions/answer_keys`). Strategy unchanged: keep content free as the SEO moat; differentiator = trustworthy rubric-anchored scoring.
>
> **2026-07-17 decision — Stripe replaces Paddle.** Founder created a Stripe account and chose to launch on it. Consequence: **we are now merchant of record** — global VAT/GST registration thresholds and chargeback liability sit with us, not the processor (the §4.1 Paddle rationale still describes the trade-off accurately; it is now an accepted risk, mitigated by enabling **Stripe Tax** and monitoring registration thresholds). Revisit Paddle/MoR if international tax exposure grows.

## 0. TL;DR

- **Free forever:** all practice content (Reading/Listening passages, questions, auto-scoring, band conversion). This is the SEO engine and must never be paywalled.
- **Gated (the product we sell):** AI scoring of Writing & Speaking (rubric-anchored, per-criterion feedback), "unlimited" scores under fair-use daily caps (§5.3), the Realtime AI speaking examiner (metered in minutes, §9), progress analytics, an ad-free experience, and mock-test / export features.
- **Free metering:** anonymous users sign up first; each signed-in free account receives **1 lifetime Writing score** on the mini model. The result reveals the overall band and first criterion, with the rest teased behind Premium. Speaking stays Premium-only.
- **Premium limits (§5.3):** Writing 2/day, 10/week, 30/month; recorded Speaking 1/day, 5/week, 15/month; Realtime examiner **60 min/period** global (30 on PPP plans). Current unit economics and the service-role cost views are documented in `docs/AI-COST-CONTROLS.md`.
- **Prices (USD, global list):** **$8.99/mo**, **$49.99/year (~$4.17/mo — the highlighted plan)**, and a **$14.99 non-renewing 30-day Exam Pass** (the highlighted plan in PPP markets, where recurring cards are often declined). Eligible PPP markets use separate server-selected prices; Gulf markets remain full price. No fictitious anchor prices: discounts appear only when a real Stripe coupon is attached.
- **Payments:** **Stripe** (see decision note above) — Checkout + Billing subscriptions, webhook → `users.plan`; PPP implemented as separate Stripe Prices selected server-side by request geo (`x-vercel-ip-country`). Stripe Tax support is implemented, but live activation remains pending account setup and `STRIPE_AUTOMATIC_TAX=1`; tax registrations are our responsibility as MoR.
- **MVP paid launch:** Supabase Auth (anon → Google/email) → server-side metering → Writing scoring API → Stripe Checkout + webhook → `users.plan` gate. Everything else (analytics dashboards, speaking, exports) ships after money is flowing.

## 1. Guiding principles

### 1.1 What stays free forever — and why

| Free forever | Why |
|---|---|
| All Reading & Listening passages, questions, options, answer keys | These are the indexed, crawlable pages that rank. Content **is** the acquisition channel. Gating it kills the funnel. |
| Auto-scoring for Reading/Listening (`answer_keys` compare, `band_tables` conversion) | Zero marginal cost (pure compute, no LLM). Auto-scoring is the hook that gets users to sign in and creates the "now try Writing" upgrade moment. |
| Writing/Speaking **prompts** and cue cards | Same SEO logic — the prompt pages rank for "IELTS Task 2 sample question X". The scoring of a user's answer is the paid part, not the prompt. |
| First AI Writing score (the lifetime sample) | A prospect must feel the quality of the rubric-anchored feedback before paying. The free Writing score is the demo; Speaking remains Premium-only. |

**Principle:** *We never charge for content or for auto-scored skills. We use one Writing evaluation as the demo, then charge for continued Writing evaluation, all Speaking evaluation, and the retention layer (analytics, fair-use scoring, no ads).*

### 1.2 What is gate-able

1. **Writing scores after the lifetime sample, plus all Speaking scores** — the core paid unit (real LLM cost, real value).
2. **Progress analytics** — trend of `scores.overall_band` and per-criterion `scores.criteria` over time, built from `attempts` + `scores`. Cheap to build, sticky, only meaningful once a user has history → natural subscriber perk.
3. **Ad-free experience** — remove AdSense for subscribers (both a perk and an AdSense-policy hygiene win, §6).
4. **Full mock tests / timed exam mode** — bundle 4 skills into one timed sitting with a combined band; a premium framing of existing content.
5. **Model quality / turnaround** — the lifetime Writing sample can use the cheaper model; paid scores use the stronger scoring pass and priority queue.
6. **Exports** — PDF band report / feedback download (trivial to build, high perceived value for a study record).

**Non-goals:** no gating of raw passage HTML, no login-wall on content pages (kills SEO + AdSense), no dark-pattern cancellation.

---

## 2. The staged ladder

Each stage lists the **trigger to advance**, **free vs gated**, **schema mapping**, **prerequisites**, and **revenue math**.

Traffic assumptions used throughout (two scenarios, held constant across stages):

- **Conservative:** 50,000 organic sessions/month, ~55→150 passages.
- **Moderate:** 200,000 organic sessions/month, content expanded to 300+ passages.

Funnel assumptions (industry-typical for free-content edtech): ~8% of sessions create an account when a value gate appears; of engaged signed-in users, **1.5% (conservative) → 3% (moderate)** convert to paid once metering + paywall exist. Writing/Speaking is a smaller slice of total traffic than Reading, so paid conversion is computed off signed-in *active* users, not raw sessions.

---

### Stage 0 — Today (baseline, live)

- **Historical baseline:** everything was free and nothing was gated. The current launch model is described in Stages 2–3 below.
- **Revenue:** AdSense only. At $50k sessions/mo and a realistic edtech RPM of ~$3–6 (international traffic, mostly India/MENA/SEA which pays low CPMs), that is **~$150–300/mo**; at 200k sessions, **~$600–1,200/mo**. This is the floor we protect, not grow.
- **Prereqs:** none. **Trigger to advance:** decision to wire auth (below).

---

### Stage 1 — Auth + Accounts (no money yet, unlocks everything)

- **Trigger to advance:** Supabase Auth wired; `attempts`/`scores` reliably attach to a stable `users.id` across the anon→Google/email upgrade.
- **Free:** all content **plus** the ability to save attempts and see your own history.
- **Gated:** nothing yet — this stage exists to create identity so metering and payments are possible.
- **Schema mapping:**
  - Anonymous sign-in on first visit → `auth.users` row (`is_anonymous=true`) → trigger `handle_new_user()` mirrors into `public.users` and seeds `public.user_quotas`. The legacy `ai_scores_remaining` column remains for migration compatibility; the current free Writing sample is enforced by `free_writing_score_used_at`.
  - Upgrade (link Google / magic-link) preserves `auth.users.id`, so all `attempts`/`scores` stay attached. Already handled by `handle_user_update()`.
- **Prereqs:** Supabase Auth config (anonymous + Google OAuth + email OTP); front-end sign-in flow; RLS already defined in `0005`.
- **Revenue math:** $0 direct. Value = it converts anonymous traffic into addressable users and makes the free meter enforceable per-identity.

---

### Stage 2 — Free AI-scoring meter (the demo)

- **Trigger to advance:** Writing scoring API route live; `user_quotas` decrement path proven transactional.
- **Free:** anonymous visitors must create or link a free account; each signed-in, non-anonymous free account gets **1** AI Writing score as a lifetime sample. Speaking scoring remains Premium-only.
- **Gated:** the second Writing score and all Speaking scores → contextual upgrade prompt.
- **Schema mapping (exact):**
  - `user_quotas.free_writing_score_used_at` (timestamptz) = the lifetime sample marker.
  - `consume_ai_score(uuid,text)` locks the quota row and stamps the marker transactionally before returning `{allowed:true, free:true}`.
  - Each completed score writes a `scores` row (`overall_band`, `criteria` JSON, `model`, `rubric_id`, `feedback_html`) tied to an `attempts` row (`skill='writing'`, `responses` = the essay).
- **Prereqs:** Stage 1; the scoring API route; a chosen scoring model; `rubrics` seeded for Writing.
- **Revenue math:** still ad-only, but this is the conversion instrument. Every user who hits "0 remaining" is a warm paywall impression. Expect **8–15%** of users who complete their free scores to see the upgrade modal within their first session.

---

### Stage 3 — Paywall + Subscriptions (money on)

- **Trigger to advance:** Stripe account live; webhook endpoint deployed; `users.plan` column live.
- **Free:** content + one lifetime Writing sample score + basic own-history view + ads.
- **Gated (Premium):** continued Writing scoring and all Speaking scoring under the published fair-use caps; progress analytics; ad-free; export; full mock mode; stronger scoring model.
- **Schema mapping (exact):**
  - `users.plan` in (`free`,`premium`) — the gate the scoring route checks.
  - `users.plan_status` (`active`,`past_due`,`canceled`,`refunded`).
  - `users.plan_renews_at` (timestamptz).
  - `users.stripe_customer_id`, `users.stripe_subscription_id` — reconcile webhooks → user.
  - Scoring route logic: resolve Premium/Exam Pass/pause entitlement server-side; Premium uses daily fair-use counters, while free accounts can consume the lifetime Writing marker once.
- **Prereqs:** Stage 2; Stripe products/prices created; webhook handler (§4); billing UI.
- **Revenue math:**

  | | Conservative (50k sess) | Moderate (200k sess) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Signed-in active users/mo | ~4,000 | ~20,000 |
  | Paid conversion | 1.5% | 3.0% |
  | Paying subscribers | ~60 | ~600 |
  | Blended ARPU (mix of mo/6-mo/annual + PPP) | ~$4.20/mo | ~$4.20/mo |
  | **Subscription MRR** | **~$250/mo** | **~$2,500/mo** |
  | AdSense (free users, ads-on) | ~$150–300 | ~$600–1,200 |
  | **Total/mo** | **~$400–550** | **~$3,100–3,700** |

  Note: blended ARPU is deliberately low because the hero SKU is the 6-month prepay and a large share of buyers take PPP pricing. LLM COGS at 0.3–1.3¢/score is a rounding error against this (a heavy subscriber scoring 100 essays/mo costs ~$0.30–1.30).

---

### Stage 4 — Retention & expansion (grow LTV)

- **Trigger to advance:** ≥100 paying subs; churn measured.
- **Free:** unchanged. **Gated:** deepen premium — Speaking scoring (audio → transcript → score), examiner-style model answers, weakness-targeted passage recommendations, streaks.
- **Schema mapping:** `scores` already supports `skill='speaking'` and per-criterion `criteria`; Speaking adds a transcription step (audio in Storage `listening-audio`-style bucket) before scoring. Analytics reads `attempts`+`scores` time series.
- **Prereqs:** Stage 3 revenue; speaking capture UI; transcription model.
- **Revenue math:** primarily lifts ARPU/retention rather than adding a new line — annual-plan attach and lower churn push blended ARPU toward $5–6 and LTV up materially.

---

## 3. Pricing recommendation

### 3.1 Global list prices (USD) — current, as sold on /pricing

Source of truth: `src/lib/saleConfig.js`. Three SKUs are sellable; `CHECKOUT_SKUS` in `lib/billing.js` enforces it.

| SKU | Price | Effective /mo | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly | **$8.99** | $8.99 | Entry point while a test date is unsettled |
| **Annual (BEST VALUE)** | **$49.99** | **~$4.17** | Highlighted plan outside PPP markets; maximum cash upfront + retention |
| **Exam Pass** | **$14.99** | n/a | One payment for **30 days**; never renews. Highlighted plan **in PPP markets** |

There are **no struck-through anchor prices anywhere**. A discount is only ever displayed when a real Stripe coupon is attached at checkout (`PROMO` in `src/lib/saleConfig.js`), and `pages/api/billing/checkout.js` refuses the session unless Stripe reports the same `percent_off` the page advertised.

Why the Exam Pass leads in PPP markets: Indian cards routinely reject recurring charges without a mandate, while one-off charges succeed. Elsewhere the annual plan leads because IELTS prep is a **fixed-duration project** and a prepay converts better than a rolling monthly plan while cutting churn and refund exposure.

**Retired from sale** (still billing existing subscribers; lookup keys retained in `LOOKUP_BY_SKU`, and both remain upgradable to annual): 3-month $19.99 / $8.99 PPP, 6-month $29.99. Nobody is re-priced — Stripe keeps billing archived prices.

### 3.2 PPP-discounted tiers (eligible lower-income markets)

PPP is implemented as separate Stripe Prices selected **server-side** from trusted request geo (`x-vercel-ip-country`), set at **~55% off** in eligible markets. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Syria, Iran, and Sudan are explicitly excluded from PPP selection.

| SKU | Global | PPP (India/MENA/SEA) | Stripe lookup keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly | $8.99 | **$3.99** | `premium_monthly` / `premium_monthly_ppp` |
| Annual | $49.99 | **$19.99** | `premium_annual` / `premium_annual_ppp` |
| Exam Pass (30 days, one-time) | $14.99 | **$5.99** | `premium_exam_pass` / `premium_exam_pass_ppp` |

Catalogue changes go through `scripts/configure-exam-pass-annual.mjs` (dry run by default, `--apply` to write). Stripe price amounts are immutable, so it creates a replacement price with `transfer_lookup_key: true` and archives the superseded one.

PPP is not optional here: a $8.99 global price is a hard wall in ₹/₨ markets, and unauthorized-region full-price sales drive chargebacks. Server-side PPP price selection both lifts conversion and cuts fraud/refund rates. (Note: Stripe's UPI support is limited vs Paddle's — a known conversion loss for Indian traffic; monitor and revisit.)

### 3.3 Justification vs named competitors (current 2026 prices)

| Competitor | Current price | Positioning vs us |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenIELTS** | ~$19/mo | We undercut at $9.99/mo and ~$5/mo on the hero SKU. |
| **IELTS Mocks** | ~$20 / 30 days | We are ~half, with free content on top. |
| **IELTS Writing AI Checker (app)** | $14.99/mo | Single-skill; we're cheaper and multi-skill. |
| **Sprechify** | $11–$23/mo | Voice-first; we're broader + cheaper. |
| **ielts.international** | from $4.99/mo | Lowest advertised; our differentiator is *trustworthy rubric-anchored* scoring + a huge free content library, not a race to the bottom. |
| **Magoosh IELTS** | ~$109–180 / 6 mo | Course, not scoring. Our 6-mo hero at $29.99 is an order of magnitude cheaper and complements rather than competes. |
| **E2Language** | ~$79/mo & up | Live/tutoring premium tier; we're self-serve AI at a fraction. |
| **IELTS Liz** | Free | The proof that free content wins traffic — we out-monetize it by adding paid AI scoring on top of a similarly-free library. |

**Net:** priced at the value floor of the AI-scoring cohort ($9.99 anchor, ~$5 hero), well under course/tutoring incumbents, with PPP to win the volume markets, and differentiated on *scoring trust + free SEO library* rather than price alone.

## 4. Payments implementation (Stripe on Next.js + Supabase)

### 4.1 The Paddle rationale (historical) and what switching to Stripe accepts

The original plan chose Paddle as merchant-of-record because it remits VAT/GST in 200+ countries, owns chargeback liability, and ships localized/PPP pricing + local rails (UPI etc.) out of the box, at ~5% + $0.50/txn. **On 2026-07-17 the founder chose Stripe instead** (~2.9% + 30¢). What we accept by doing so:

- **We are merchant of record.** Tax calculation/collection is handled by enabling **Stripe Tax**, but *registration and remittance* in each jurisdiction (EU VAT OSS, India GST, UK VAT, etc.) is our obligation once thresholds are crossed. Action: monitor Stripe Tax's registration-threshold dashboard monthly.
- **Chargeback liability is ours** (exam-prep is dispute-heavy — §7). Mitigations: favor the prepaid 6-month hero SKU, instant first-value delivery, clear refund policy, Stripe Radar on.
- **PPP is DIY:** implemented as separate Stripe Prices chosen server-side from request geo (never client-chosen — a client-picked PPP price is a coupon anyone can abuse).
- Upside: lower fees, first-party Checkout/Portal/Radar, and no Paddle approval gate.

### 4.2 Schema additions (columns to add to existing tables)

```
-- public.users  (add):
  plan                   text    not null default 'free',    -- 'free' | 'premium'
  plan_status            text    not null default 'inactive',-- 'active'|'trialing'|'past_due'|'canceled'|'refunded'|'inactive'
  plan_renews_at         timestamptz,
  plan_started_at        timestamptz,
  premium_since          timestamptz,
  plan_sku               text,
  plan_expires_at        timestamptz, -- one-time Exam Pass
  exam_date              date,
  canceled_at            timestamptz,
  billing_pause_until    timestamptz,
  billing_pause_used_at  timestamptz, -- enforces the one-time pause offer
  stripe_customer_id     text,     -- unique, indexed
  stripe_subscription_id text,     -- unique, indexed

-- public.user_quotas  (lifetime sample + premium fair-use/realtime meters):
  ai_scores_remaining        int          -- legacy compatibility; not the current free meter
  period_resets_at           timestamptz  -- legacy compatibility
  writing_scores_today       int          -- premium daily counter
  speaking_scores_today      int          -- premium daily counter
  daily_counters_date        date         -- rollover marker
  writing_scores_week        int          -- premium ISO-week counter
  speaking_scores_week       int          -- premium ISO-week counter
  weekly_counters_start      date         -- Monday UTC rollover marker
  writing_scores_month       int          -- premium calendar-month counter
  speaking_scores_month      int          -- premium calendar-month counter
  monthly_counters_start     date         -- UTC month rollover marker
  realtime_seconds_remaining int          -- Realtime examiner meter (§9)
  realtime_period_resets_at  timestamptz
  free_writing_score_used_at timestamptz  -- lifetime sample audit marker

-- public.lifecycle_emails:
  -- service-role-only outbox with idempotency, retries, suppression, and send state
```

Unique indexes on `users.stripe_customer_id` and `users.stripe_subscription_id` for idempotent webhook upserts. All plan writes are **service-role only**: a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger rejects changes to `plan*`/`stripe_*` columns unless the role is `service_role` (client keeps its `0005` update policy for profile fields only).

```

### 4.4 Integration outline (this stack)

**Checkout (server-created):** `POST /api/billing/checkout` — requires a signed-in, **non-anonymous** Supabase session. Creates/reuses the Stripe Customer, resolves the price by server-trusted geography, and creates either a subscription Checkout Session or a one-time Exam Pass payment. Client input never chooses PPP eligibility or arbitrary discounts. The 30-day win-back offer is revalidated from cancellation history on the server.

**Webhook (server — `pages/api/webhooks/stripe.js`, bodyParser off for raw body):**
1. Verify the `stripe-signature` header via `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Reject on mismatch.
2. Use the Supabase **service role** client (never the anon key) to write.
3. Handle events idempotently, keyed on `stripe_subscription_id` (state upserts, not increments):
   - `checkout.session.completed` → map `client_reference_id`/metadata → user; set `plan='premium'`, `plan_status='active'`, `plan_started_at`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, seed realtime minutes (§9).
   - one-time Exam Pass checkout (`mode: payment`) → set a 30-day `plan_expires_at`, seed realtime minutes, and never create a renewing subscription. A pass holder may later subscribe (the subscription clears `plan_expires_at`); an account already holding a recurring plan is refused a second purchase with 409 `already_premium`, and a pass holder is refused a second pass with 409 `already_exam_pass`.
   - `customer.subscription.created`/`updated` → sync `plan_status` from Stripe status (`active`/`trialing` → premium-active; `past_due` → grace; `canceled`/`unpaid`/`incomplete_expired` → downgrade at period end), refresh `plan_renews_at` from `current_period_end`; either `cancel_at_period_end=true` or an explicit future `cancel_at` → `plan_status='canceled'` but **retain premium until `plan_renews_at`**. Stripe Customer Portal can use either cancellation representation, so both are required.
   - `customer.subscription.deleted` → `plan='free'`, `plan_status='canceled'`.
   - `invoice.paid` → resync entitlement and refill the Realtime allowance for the renewal period.
   - `invoice.payment_failed` → `plan_status='past_due'` (grace window; Stripe Smart Retries handle dunning).
   - `charge.refunded` / `charge.dispute.created` → `plan='free'`, `plan_status='refunded'` immediately.
4. Return 200 fast; unrecognized events are acknowledged and ignored.

**Gating check (server — inside the scoring API route):** `consume_ai_score` reads the server-owned plan, expiry, and pause fields. Premium-active access (including a paid period after cancellation and an unexpired Exam Pass) uses fair-use daily caps (§5.3); a free account can consume its lifetime Writing marker once. Never trust a client-sent `isPremium` flag.

**Upgrades / cancellations / refunds:**
- SKU changes + cancellation → **Stripe Customer Portal** (`/api/billing/portal` creates a portal session); we consume the resulting `customer.subscription.updated`/`deleted` webhooks. Access persists to period end on cancel.
- Refund/chargeback → `charge.refunded`/`charge.dispute.created` flips them to free instantly; disputes are our liability (Radar + prepaid-SKU mix keeps the rate down).

## 5. Free-tier metering design

### 5.1 Allowances

| User type | Free AI scores | Reset cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Anonymous | **0** | Must create a free account |
| Signed-in free | **1 Writing score** | Lifetime; Speaking remains Premium-only |
| Premium | Writing 2/day, 10/week, 30/month; Speaking 1/day, 5/week, 15/month | UTC day/week/month rollover |

Rationale: signup is the abuse boundary and the sample reward. The free result reveals the overall band and first criterion; the remaining criteria and detailed corrections are visibly teased behind Premium. `free_writing_score_used_at` makes the lifetime use auditable and immune to subscription churn.

### 5.2 Server-side enforcement (never client-trusted)

The scoring route runs on Vercel with the **service role** key. The decrement and the score insert must be **one atomic operation** so a user cannot fire concurrent requests to get free scores past the limit. Implement as a Postgres RPC (`SECURITY DEFINER`) called from the route:

```
-- pseudo-logic of the RPC, executed transactionally:
-- 1. validate auth.uid() = p_uid (or service_role) and lock user_quotas
-- 2. compute active subscription / Exam Pass / billing-pause entitlement
-- 3. free Writing with unused lifetime marker -> stamp marker and return free:true
-- 4. all other free requests -> return premium_required
-- 5. premium -> roll day/week/month counters, enforce all three caps, increment
```

Key rules:
- `FOR UPDATE` row lock prevents the concurrency race.
- The client never sends the remaining count; it only reads it for display via RLS (`user_quotas` is client-readable, service-write-only per `0004`/`0005`).
- The free route selects `SCORING_MODEL_FREE`; paid scores select `SCORING_MODEL_PAID`.
- If the LLM call fails after a meter increment, the route performs a compensating refund where applicable.
- Return **HTTP 402** for `premium_required` or a fair-use cap so the front-end shows the contextual paywall deterministically.

### 5.3 Premium fair-use limits (decided 2026-07-17)

Premium is marketed as "unlimited AI scoring" but carries **abuse caps** sized so no single account can run away with LLM spend (human essay-writing speed bounds organic use; these caps bound scripted use):

| Feature | Premium limit | Worst-case COGS/mo | Typical COGS/mo |
|---|---|---|---|
| Writing AI scores (`gpt-5.1`) | **2/day, 10/week, 30/month** | ~$0.75 | ~$0.45 |
| Recorded Speaking scores (Whisper + `gpt-5.1`) | **1/day, 5/week, 15/month** | ~$0.56 | ~$0.34 |
| Realtime AI examiner (§9) | **60 min/period** global / **30 min/period** PPP | ~$3.60 reserved | measured after rollout |
| **Total** | | **~$4.50 hard ceiling** | **~$0.90** |

The score caps reserve about **$1.31/month conservatively** at full utilization. Realtime is the dominant variable cost; the current 30-minute PPP allowance has thin worst-case margin and must be reviewed using `ai_usage_cost_daily` before it is raised. Enforcement: `consume_ai_score(p_uid, p_skill)` grants one lifetime mini-model Writing sample, keeps Speaking Premium-only, and rolls UTC day/week/month counters; Realtime seconds decrement before a session token is minted.

---

## 6. AdSense coexistence

### 6.1 Where ads live

- **Ads ON:** all public/free content pages (passage/question pages), for anonymous and signed-in **free** users. This is where the crawlable traffic is and where AdSense revenue comes from.
- **Ads OFF:** for `plan='premium'` users everywhere, and inside the scoring/results/analytics surfaces regardless of plan (paid product surfaces should never show ads; also avoids ads next to a paywall). Gate the AdSense component on `plan !== 'premium'`.

### 6.2 Paywall + structured data

- Any partially-gated page (e.g. a results page showing a teaser of the AI feedback then a paywall) must use **`isAccessibleForFree`** schema.org markup with a `hasPart`/`cssSelector` describing the gated block, so Google understands the paywall and does not treat it as cloaking. Fully-free content pages need no such markup.
- Keep the free content genuinely free to crawlers — do not serve different content to Googlebot vs users.

### 6.3 "Low-value content" policy risk (templated question pages) + mitigation

AdSense/Search can flag large sets of thin, templated pages (55→300 near-identical question layouts) as **low-value / scaled content**. Mitigations:
1. **Substantive unique text per passage** — each passage already has real body copy; ensure Writing/Speaking prompt pages carry unique model-answer notes, examiner tips, and vocabulary, not just a bare prompt.
2. **Add editorial value** the templates lack: band descriptors explained, common mistakes, sample answers — turns a "question page" into a "lesson."
3. **Canonicalize / consolidate** near-duplicate variants; avoid indexing thin auto-generated permutations from `ingest_queue` output until editorially reviewed (the review queue already exists — enforce it before publishing to `status='published'`).
4. **Gate ads, not content:** never add more ad units to thin pages to juice RPM — that's exactly what triggers policy review.
5. As subscription revenue grows, **AdSense dependence should fall**; if policy risk ever bites, the business still stands on subscriptions.

## 7. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Reality | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **"IELTS" trademark** | IELTS is a registered trademark (British Council / IDP / Cambridge). Using it in the brand/domain (`ielts-bank.com`) and marketing carries real risk. | Add a clear **"not affiliated with or endorsed by the IELTS partners"** disclaimer in footer + about + checkout. Use "IELTS" descriptively ("practice for the IELTS exam"), never implying official status. Avoid official logos. Have a fallback brand name ready; keep the trademark-safe descriptive positioning. Consider IP counsel before scaling paid ads on the brand term. |
| **Refunds / chargebacks** (exam-prep is high-dispute: buyers dispute after their test date or after "not enough time") | Chargebacks can carry fees and threaten processor standing. | **Chargeback liability is now ours (Stripe, we are MoR)** — Stripe Radar on, prepaid hero SKU favored, clear 14-day money-back terms, and instant first-value delivery. |
| **Seasonality** | IELTS demand spikes around intake/admissions cycles; summer/holiday lulls. | The 6-month/annual SKUs smooth cash across troughs. AdSense floor persists year-round. Plan content pushes ahead of known intake peaks. |
| **AdSense policy** (low-value templated pages; invalid traffic) | Account suspension would zero the current revenue line. | §6.3 mitigations; editorial review queue gating; diversify to subscription revenue so AdSense isn't load-bearing. |
| **LLM cost blow-out from abuse** | A scripted attacker could burn LLM spend via the scoring route. | Server-side metering (§5) caps free usage; auth required for scoring; rate-limit per IP/user; premium is bounded by human essay-writing speed. COGS at 0.3–1.3¢/score stays negligible. |
| **Scoring trust** (our differentiator) | If AI bands feel arbitrary, the product dies. | Rubric-anchored scoring using seeded `rubrics`; store `model` + `rubric_id` on every `scores` row for auditability; show per-criterion reasoning; calibrate against known-band sample essays. |

## 8. Prioritized build checklist — "what to build first to start earning"

Mapped to the roadmap: **auth → metering → paywall → analytics.** Ship in this order; each step is releasable.

### Phase A — Foundation (no revenue, unblocks everything)
1. **Wire Supabase Auth**: anonymous sign-in on load; Google OAuth + email magic-link upgrade (triggers already built in `0006`). Verify `attempts`/`scores` survive the anon→identified upgrade.
2. **Front-end account state**: read `users` + `user_quotas` via RLS for display.

### Phase B — Metering (no revenue, builds the demo + the wall)
3. **Writing scoring API route** (`pages/api/score/writing.js`, server/service-role): prompt + rubric → LLM → insert `attempts` + `scores` (per-criterion `criteria`, `model`, `rubric_id`, `feedback_html`).
4. **Transactional meter RPC** (§5): `FOR UPDATE` lifetime free-Writing marker plus premium daily fair-use counters; return 402 at the appropriate gate.
5. **Paywall modal** triggered on HTTP 402.

### Phase C — Minimum Viable Paid Launch  ← **first money**
6. **Add billing columns** to `users` (§4.2) + service-role-only write trigger; premium daily counters + realtime meter on `user_quotas`.
7. **Stripe setup**: one Pro product, 6 sellable prices by `lookup_key` (Monthly, Annual, Exam Pass; global + PPP) plus the retired 3-month/6-month prices that still bill existing subscribers; promo-code support for launch discounts and E2E verification.
8. **Checkout**: `POST /api/billing/checkout` → server-resolved price (geo → PPP) → Stripe Checkout redirect.
9. **Webhook route** (`pages/api/webhooks/stripe.js`): signature verify + idempotent upsert of `plan`/`plan_status`/`plan_renews_at`/`stripe_*` (§4.4).
10. **Gate in the scoring route**: signed-in free receives one lifetime Writing sample; premium enters fair-use daily caps (§5.3); Speaking stays Premium-only.
11. **AdSense gate**: hide ads when `plan='premium'`.
12. **/pricing page** + **Basic billing/account section** + link to Stripe Customer Portal for cancel/update.

> **MVP-paid-launch = steps 1–12.** That is: auth, one scored skill (Writing), server-side free meter, Stripe Checkout + webhook, `users.plan` gate, ad-free perk. Nothing else is required to take the first dollar. Target this before any dashboard work.

### Phase D — Retention & expansion (after money flows)
13. **Progress analytics** dashboard from `attempts` + `scores` time series (premium perk).
14. **Speaking scoring** (audio → transcript → `scores` with `skill='speaking'`).
15. **PDF export** of band report (premium).
16. **Full timed mock mode** (bundle 4 skills, combined band).
17. **Lifecycle email outbox** for signup/purchase/weekly sends plus a 30-day validated win-back.

## 9. Realtime AI Speaking Examiner (premium flagship feature)

> **Audio assessment update, 2026-09-06:** A local, default-off Realtime 2.1 implementation adds candidate-audio pronunciation assessment and four-criterion practice estimates. Current live pricing/allowances have not changed. See [implementation, cost sensitivity, and pilot recommendation](realtime-speaking-2026-09-06/REVIEW.md) before enabling it; the historical $0.06/minute assumption is not a hard spend ceiling.

> **Status: SHIPPED 2026-07-17** — `/speaking-examiner` (WebRTC client), `/api/realtime/session` (metered mint, refund-on-failure), `/api/score/speaking-realtime` (post-interview `gpt-5.1` rubric pass). Verified live: mint + metering + scoring + persistence; the voice conversation itself was validated by component (automated E2E cannot capture microphone audio).

**Decision (2026-07-17):** build Speaking's premium tier on the OpenAI Realtime voice API — a live AI examiner that conducts the full 3-part IELTS interview (adaptive Part 1 questions, timed Part 2 cue card with 1-min prep, probing Part 3 follow-ups), instead of only the current record → Whisper → transcript-score pipeline.

### 9.1 Why

1. **Real exam simulation** — the actual test is an 11–14 min live interview; a static cue card can't simulate adaptive follow-ups, interruptions, or timing. This is the largest gap between our product and the exam.
2. **Unlocks the 4th criterion** — the model hears audio natively, enabling pronunciation/intonation *feedback* (qualitative only; do not issue a pronunciation *band* until calibrated — AI pronunciation banding reliability is unproven).
3. **Competitive parity** with the voice-first cohort (Sprechify $11–23/mo, SmallTalk2Me, Langogh, ielts.international) while keeping our price undercut.

### 9.2 Architecture (hybrid)

- **Conduct** the interview on the model selected by `OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL`, defaulting to **`gpt-realtime-2.1`** after founder testing found the mini tier materially weaker. Client connects to OpenAI directly via WebRTC; our API route only mints short-lived ephemeral session tokens **after** the minutes-quota check, with hard session-duration caps.
- **Score** afterwards with the existing `gpt-5.1` rubric-anchored pass over the captured transcript/audio (scoring trust stays in the strong text model — the voice model is the examiner, not the grader).
- Re-evaluate the mini tier only if its examiner quality improves enough to preserve the product experience; cost remains bounded by the monthly minute meter and hard session-duration caps.

### 9.3 Cost & metering

| | Per full 14-min mock | Per 5-min drill |
|---|---|---|
| Realtime mini (cached) | ~$0.30–0.70 | ~$0.10–0.25 |
| Realtime flagship | ~$1.00–1.60 | ~$0.35–0.55 |
| (Current async pipeline) | ~$0.02–0.03/score | — |

- **Metered in minutes, not scores**: premium includes **60 min/mo** (global) / **30 min/mo** (PPP) — ≈4 full mocks. Schema: `user_quotas.realtime_seconds_remaining` + `realtime_period_resets_at`, seeded on subscription activation and refilled on renewal (webhook).
- **Free tier:** no Realtime access; optional one-time **3-min taster** (~10–15¢ COGS) as a paywall demo.
- **Never unlimited** — unbounded Realtime would require ~$15–20/mo pricing and surrenders our price positioning.
- **Abuse surface:** a live session burns money per-minute; quota check happens **before** token mint, sessions carry server-set max duration, and per-IP rate limits apply to the mint route.

### 9.4 Expected P&L impact

At the moderate scenario (600 subs, ~40% speaking adoption, ~4 mocks/mo avg on mini): **~$300–650/mo COGS vs ~$2,500 MRR** — material but fine, and it should lift conversion/retention in the voice-first competitor cohort we currently concede.

## Appendix — Unit economics & sources

**Per-score COGS (2026 model prices):** a Writing Task 2 evaluation is ~1.5–3k input tokens (essay + rubric + instructions) and ~0.8–1.5k output tokens. At GPT-4o mini ($0.15/$0.60 per 1M in/out) or Gemini 2.0/3.x Flash ($0.10/$0.40) that is **~0.1–0.3¢** single-pass; a two-pass or stronger-model paid score, or Speaking with transcription, pushes it to **~0.4–1.3¢**. Even a power subscriber scoring 100 items/month costs **<$1.30** in LLM spend against ~$4–10 revenue.

**Infra fixed cost (2026):** Supabase Pro **$25/mo**, Vercel Pro **$20/mo** (+usage, realistically ~$40–70 at moderate traffic). Total platform floor **~$50–100/mo** — covered by the AdSense floor alone; every subscriber is near-pure margin after Stripe's ~3–4% (fees + Stripe Tax/Billing overhead).
